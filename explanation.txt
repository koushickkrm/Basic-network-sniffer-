get_mac_addr function explanation:
Explaining this line: bytes_addr = map('{:02x}'.format, bytes_addr)

When you apply '{:02x}'.format to each byte in bytes_addr using map, it will convert each byte to a two-character hexadecimal representation. The result will be an iterator of hexadecimal strings, where each string represents one byte of the original data as a hexadecimal value.

For example, if bytes_addr is [192, 168, 0, 1], applying the map('{:02x}'.format, bytes_addr) command would give these values ['c0', 'a8', '00', '01'] representing the hexadecimal representation of each byte in the array.

main function explanation:
Explaining this line: conn = socket.socket(socket.AF_PACKET, socket.SOCK_RAW, socket.ntohs(3))

socket.AF_PACKET: This is a constant representing the address family to be used by the socket. AF_PACKET is typically used for low-level packet manipulation, and it's often used in conjunction with the SOCK_RAW socket type.

socket.SOCK_RAW: This is the socket type, which specifies that you want a raw socket. A raw socket allows you to work with the network packets at a low level, meaning you can send and receive raw data without the operating system processing the data at a higher level (e.g., without transport or application layer processing). Raw sockets are often used for network analysis, packet capturing, or creating custom network protocols.

socket.ntohs(3): This part uses the socket.ntohs function to convert a 16-bit number from network byte order (big-endian) to the host byte order. In this case, 3 is a common value used to specify the Ethernet protocol number for IPv4, which corresponds to the Internet Protocol (IP). This value is used to filter incoming packets by protocol type.

ipv4_packet function explanation:
Explaining these lines:

python
Copy code
version_header_length = data[0]
version = version_header_length >> 4
header_length = (version_header_length & 15) * 4
version_header_length = data[0]: This line extracts the first byte from the data parameter, which presumably represents the header of an IPv4 packet. The header of an IPv4 packet is 20 bytes long (excluding any optional fields), and the first byte contains both the version of the IP protocol and the header length.

version = version_header_length >> 4: This line extracts the version of the IP protocol by right-shifting the value of version_header_length by 4 bits. In the IPv4 header, the first 4 bits represent the version, so shifting by 4 bits to the right isolates those bits. The result is the version of the IP protocol.

header_length = (version_header_length & 15) * 4: This line extracts the header length from the version_header_length by performing a bitwise AND operation with 15 (binary 1111). The header length is represented in the last 4 bits of the first byte of the IPv4 header. After extracting these 4 bits, the code multiplies the result by 4 to get the length in bytes. The header length is specified in 32-bit words, so multiplying by 4 converts it to bytes.

tcp_segment function explanation:
Explaining this line: flag_urg = (offset_reserved_flags & 32) >> 5

The reason for shifting right by 5 positions (>> 5) instead of 6 in the context of the provided code is related to the bit positions used to represent specific flags in the TCP header.

In the TCP header, the offset_reserved_flags field is a 16-bit field where specific bits represent different control flags. The bits are numbered from 0 to 15 (from the rightmost bit, which is the least significant bit, to the leftmost bit, which is the most significant bit).

The flags being checked in the code are:

flag_urg: Bit 5
flag_ack: Bit 4
flag_psh: Bit 3
flag_rst: Bit 2
flag_syn: Bit 1
flag_fin: Bit 0

Explaining this line: offset = (offset_reserved_flags >> 12) * 4

offset_reserved_flags: This presumably represents a 16-bit field in the TCP header, where the higher-order bits indicate the header offset.
offset_reserved_flags >> 12: The '>>' operator is a right shift, which shifts the bits of offset_reserved_flags 12 positions to the right. This effectively isolates the higher-order bits that represent the header offset.
* 4: After shifting, the result is multiplied by 4. In the context of TCP headers, the header offset is specified in 32-bit words. Since each word is 4 bytes, multiplying the shifted value by 4 converts the offset to bytes.

In summary, this line of code is extracting the header offset from the offset_reserved_flags field in a TCP header.
